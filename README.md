This Boosting Macro is made and tested (as of now) for the Ubuntu Distribution (22.04) of Linux. It may require tweaks to have it work on other Distributions.

## What does it do?
This Boosting Macro automatically sends key inputs which you have selected at your selected interval to use items on your hotbar.
